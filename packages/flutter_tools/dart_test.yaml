# Some of our tests take an absurdly long time to run, and on some
# hosts they can take even longer due to the host suddenly being
# overloaded. For this reason, we set the test timeout to
# significantly more than it would be by default, and we never set the
# timeouts in the tests themselves.
timeout: 15m
