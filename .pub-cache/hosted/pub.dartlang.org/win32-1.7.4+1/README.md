![Dart/Win32](https://github.com/timsneath/win32/blob/main/doc/images/win32.png?raw=true)

A package that wraps some of the most common Win32 API calls using FFI to make
them accessible to Dart code without requiring a C compiler or the Windows SDK.

[![pub package](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/win32.svg)](https://pub.dev/packages/win32)
[![Language](https://img.shields.io/badge/language-Dart-blue.svg)](https://dart.dev)

Perhaps of as much use as the APIs themselves, this package provides a variety of
instructive examples for more complex FFI usage scenarios.

By design, this package provides minimal modifications to the Win32 API to support
Dart idioms. The goal is to provide high familiarity to an existing Win32 developer.
Other plugins may build on these primitives to provide a friendly API for Dart and
Flutter developers. A good example of that is
[filepicker_windows](https://pub.dev/packages/filepicker_windows), which offers a
common item dialog suitable for incorporation into an existing Flutter app.

## Usage

This package lets you write apps that use the Windows API directly from Dart, by
wrapping common Win32, COM and Windows Runtime APIs using Dart FFI.

You could use it to call a Win32 API like
[EnumFontFamiliesEx](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/wingdi/nf-wingdi-enumfontfamiliesexw)
to enumerate all locally-installed fonts:

or access system information that is not exposed directly by the Dart framework libraries:

You could use it to build a Windows app with Flutter that relies on Win32 APIs:

![Disk explorer screenshot](https://github.com/timsneath/win32/blob/main/doc/images/disk_explorer.png?raw=true)

You could even use it to build a traditional Win32 app, written purely in Dart, that could have come straight out of a classic Charles Petzold book on programming Windows apps:

or even, perhaps, a fully-fledged game using GDI:

![Dart Tetris for Win32 screenshot](https://github.com/timsneath/win32/blob/main/doc/images/tetris.png?raw=true)

You might even build a package that depends upon it, like [dart_console](https://pub.dev/packages/dart_console), which enables advanced console manipulation:

![Dart console ANSI color demo screenshot](https://github.com/timsneath/win32/blob/main/doc/images/console.png?raw=true)

or [filepicker_windows](https://pub.dev/packages/filepicker_windows), which provides a modern Windows file picker for Flutter:

## Getting started

Many more samples can be found in the `example\` subdirectory, along with a test
suite in the `test\` subdirectory that shows other API calls.

A good starting point is `hello.dart`. This example demonstrates creating a
Win32 window and responding to common messages such as `WM_PAINT` through a
`WindowProc` callback function.

To run it, type:

```cmd
dart example\hello.dart
```

This should display a window with a text message.

This can be compiled into a standalone Win32 executable by running:

```cmd
dart compile exe example\hello.dart -o example\bin\hello.exe
```

## Samples

### Dart samples

The package includes a number of examples in the `example` subdirectory. These
examples use the Win32 API for all UI display and do not require Flutter.

| Example            | Description                                               |

### Flutter samples

The `explorer\` subdirectory contains an example of a simple Flutter app that
uses the volume management Win32 APIs to find the disk drives connected to your
computer and their volume IDs and attached paths.

## Requirements

This package assumes the [Dart 32-bit or 64-bit compiler](https://dart.dev/get-dart),
running on Windows.

## Features and bugs

Let me know what APIs you're interested in seeing. I'm not planning to project
the entire Windows API, but I'm particularly interested in examples that either
unblock a plugin for Windows or that demonstrate more complex Windows APIs that
represent an important pattern.

Please file feature requests and bugs at the [issue tracker][tracker]. This
is a hobby project, and should not be viewed as having the same level of
quality assurance as an official package from the Dart team. I'm a product
manager having fun on my weekends!
