## Windows GDI

The Windows Graphics Device Interface, which provides functions that perform
primitive drawing functions for output to video displays and printers.
Traditional Windows applications call GDI functions directly to perform
low-level drawing (line, rectangle, ellipse), text output, font management, and
similar functions.
