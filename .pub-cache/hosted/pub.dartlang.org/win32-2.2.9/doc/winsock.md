## Windows Socket Library

Windows Sockets 2 (Winsock) enables programmers to create advanced Internet,
intranet, and other network-capable applications to transmit application data
across the wire, independent of the network protocol being used. With Winsock,
programmers are provided access to Windows networking capabilities such as
multicast and Quality of Service (QoS).
