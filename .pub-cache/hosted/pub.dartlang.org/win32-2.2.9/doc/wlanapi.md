## Wireless LAN API

The Native Wifi application programming interface (API) functions have two
purposes: to manage wireless network profiles and to manage wireless network
connections. The API elements are exposed by the Auto Configuration Module
(ACM). The exposed connection and disconnection API elements can be used to
override the automatic configuration logic.
