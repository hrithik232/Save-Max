## DirectX Video Acceleration API

DirectX Video Acceleration (DXVA) is an API and a corresponding DDI for using
hardware acceleration to speed up video processing. Software codecs and software
video processors can use DXVA to offload certain CPU-intensive operations to the
GPU. For example, a software decoder can offload the inverse discrete cosine
transform (iDCT) to the GPU.
