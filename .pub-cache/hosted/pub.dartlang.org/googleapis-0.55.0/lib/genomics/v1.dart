  ///      the system state has been explicitly fixed.  E.g., if an "rmdir"
  ///      fails because the directory is non-empty, `FAILED_PRECONDITION`
  ///      should be returned since the client should not retry unless
  ///      the files are deleted from the directory.
  ///
  /// HTTP Mapping: 400 Bad Request
  /// - "ABORTED" : The operation was aborted, typically due to a concurrency
  /// issue such as
  /// a sequencer check failure or transaction abort.

  /// See the guidelines above for deciding between `FAILED_PRECONDITION`,
  /// `ABORTED`, and `UNAVAILABLE`.
  ///
  /// HTTP Mapping: 409 Conflict
  /// - "OUT_OF_RANGE" : The operation was attempted past the valid range.
  /// E.g., seeking or
  /// reading past end-of-file.
  ///
  /// Unlike `INVALID_ARGUMENT`, this error indicates a problem that may
  /// be fixed if the system state changes. For example, a 32-bit file
  /// system will generate `INVALID_ARGUMENT` if asked to read at an
  /// offset that is not in the range [0,2^32-1], but it will generate

  ///
  /// There is a fair bit of overlap between `FAILED_PRECONDITION` and

  /// error) when it applies so that callers who are iterating through
  /// a space can easily look for an `OUT_OF_RANGE` error to detect when
  /// they are done.
  ///
  /// HTTP Mapping: 400 Bad Request
  /// - "UNIMPLEMENTED" : The operation is not implemented or is not
  /// supported/enabled in this
  /// service.
  ///
  /// HTTP Mapping: 501 Not Implemented
  /// - "INTERNAL" : Internal errors.  This means that some invariants expected
