# Changelog

v3.0.0
- Docs and file cleanup
  
v3.0.0-nullsafety.0
- Nullsafety conversion

v2.2.3
- Improve pub package score (thanks @DavBfr)
- Use const and final instead of var (thanks @DavBfr)
- Document public API members (thanks @DavBfr)

v2.2.2
- Update quick_log to latest version

v2.2.1
- Correctly use Google Auth flag (`isGoogle`) to disable padding. (thanks hpoul)

v2.2.0
- Add Google Auth flag, because they do SHA1 TOTP without Padding the secret.
- Reverting _int2bytes function back to old implementation, as the new on uses int64 which breaks flutter web and dart2js as it doesn't have support for Int64.

v2.1.0
- Fix secret paddding to follow proper TOTP secret padding and sizing for SHA256, SHA512
- Remove RFC unsupported hashes. SHA224 and SHA384 are no longer supported.
- Show warning when using anything other than SHA1, as the RFC doesn't support it so I have found that libraries don't pad correctly for HOTP.
- At the same time, SHA1 is now again the HOTP default.
- Add optional TOTP style paddding for HOTP when using SHA256 and SHA512.
- Force version 1.1.1 of Base32 library, as that was a major bug fix release that improved Base32 support.
- Add documentation and additional information on how to use this library.

v2.0.3

- Fix type error at runtime for RandomSecret generation. MR #14 (thanks readytopark)

v2.0.2

- Switch to crypto lib inplace of PointyCastle for HMAC

v2.0.1, v2.0.0

- Formatting
- No changes from rc1, accepting the 1-3 second timing difference between constant time code checks until someone can help me figure out how to make it match.

v2.0.0-rc1

- *BREAKING CHANGE* Switched default hashing algorithm to SHA256 from SHA1
