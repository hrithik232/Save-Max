# Contributing to the google maps webservice

### What you will need
- A Linux, Mac OS X, or Windows machine (note: to run and compile iOS specific parts you'll need access to a Mac OS X machine);
- git (used for source version control, installation instruction can be found [here][git]);
- Set up Dart SDK (installation instructions can be found [here][dart])
- The Flutter SDK (installation instructions can be found [here][flutter]);
- A personal GitHub account (if you don't have one, you can sign-up for free [here][github])

### Setting up your development environment
- Fork https://github.com/lejard-h/google_maps_webservice.git into your own GitHub account. If you already have a fork and you're moving to a new computer, make sure you update you fork.
- If you haven't configured your machine with an SSH key that's known to GitHub, then follow [GitHub's directions][git-ssh] to generate an SSH key.
- Clone your forked repo on your local development machine:
  ```sh
    git clone git@github.com:<your_name_here>/google_maps_webservice.git
  ``` 
- Change into the google_maps_webservice directory: 
  ```sh
     cd google_maps_webservice
  ```
- Add an upstream to the original repo, so that you can fetch updates to the library from the master repository and not your clone:
  ```sh
      git remote add upstream git@github.com:lejard-h/google_maps_webservice.git
  ```     

### Running the example project     

- Change into the example directory: 
  ```sh
   cd example 
   export API_KEY="YOUR_KEY"
   
   dart directions.dart
   dart geolocation.dart
   dart places_autocomplete.dart
   ```
