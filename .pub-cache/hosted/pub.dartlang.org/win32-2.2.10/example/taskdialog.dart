// Demonstrates a task dialog from the console.

// Requires a reference to comctl32.dll v6 in the manifest to work. An example
// is included in taskdialog.exe.manifest, but this will only be loaded if
// you first compile this example with a command such as:
//   dart compile exe taskdialog.dart
//
// An example of the manifest is found in the bin\ subdirectory as
// taskdialog.exe.manifest. Place the compiled taskdialog.exe in the same folder
// as the manifest and then when you run this it should display two task dialog
// samples.
