![Dart/Win32](https://github.com/timsneath/win32/blob/main/doc/images/win32.png?raw=true)

A package that wraps some of the most common Win32 API calls using FFI to make
them accessible to Dart code without requiring a C compiler or the Windows SDK.

![Build](https://github.com/timsneath/win32/workflows/Build/badge.svg)

In addition to exposing the APIs themselves, this package offers a variety of
instructive examples for more complex FFI usage scenarios.

By design, this package provides minimal modifications to the Win32 API to
support Dart idioms. The goal is to provide high familiarity to an existing
Win32 developer. Other Dart packages may build on these primitives to provide a
friendly API for Dart and Flutter developers. A good example of that is
[filepicker_windows](https://pub.dev/packages/filepicker_windows), which offers
a common item dialog suitable for incorporation into an existing Flutter app.

## Usage

This package lets you write apps that use the Windows API directly from Dart, by
wrapping common Win32, COM and Windows Runtime APIs using Dart FFI.

You could use it to call a Win32 API like
[EnumFontFamiliesEx](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/wingdi/nf-wingdi-enumfontfamiliesexw)
to enumerate all locally-installed fonts:

or access system information that is not exposed directly by the Dart framework
libraries:

You could use it to build a Windows app with Flutter that relies on Win32 APIs:

![Disk explorer screenshot](https://github.com/timsneath/win32/blob/main/doc/images/disk_explorer.png?raw=true)

You could even use it to build a traditional Win32 app, written purely in Dart,
that could have come straight out of a classic Charles Petzold book on
programming Windows apps:

![Dart notepad screenshot](https://github.com/timsneath/win32/blob/main/doc/images/notepad.png?raw=true)

or even, perhaps, a fully-fledged game using GDI:

![Dart Tetris for Win32 screenshot](https://github.com/timsneath/win32/blob/main/doc/images/tetris.png?raw=true)

You might even build a package that depends upon it, like
[dart_console](https://pub.dev/packages/dart_console), which enables advanced
console manipulation:

![Dart console ANSI color demo screenshot](https://github.com/timsneath/win32/blob/main/doc/images/console.png?raw=true)

or [filepicker_windows](https://pub.dev/packages/filepicker_windows), which
provides a modern Windows file picker for Flutter:

## Getting started

Many more samples can be found in the `example\` subdirectory, along with a test
suite in the `test\` subdirectory that shows other API calls.

A good starting point is `hello.dart`. This example demonstrates creating a
Win32 window and responding to common messages such as `WM_PAINT` through a
`WindowProc` callback function.

To run it, type:

```cmd
dart example\hello.dart
```

This should display a window with a text message.

This can be compiled into a standalone Win32 executable by running:

```cmd
dart compile exe example\hello.dart -o example\bin\hello.exe
```

For more information on working with the Win32 library from Dart, consult the
documentation, in particular the sections on [string
manipulation](https://pub.dev/documentation/win32/latest/win32/win32-library.html)
and [COM
objects](https://pub.dev/documentation/win32/latest/topics/com-topic.html).

### Flutter samples

The `explorer\` subdirectory contains an example of a simple Flutter app that
uses the volume management Win32 APIs to find the disk drives connected to your
computer and their volume IDs and attached paths.

## Requirements

This package assumes the [Dart 64-bit compiler](https://dart.dev/get-dart),
running on Windows. Many commands are tested on 32-bit Windows, but due to the
lack of a compiler for 32-bit executables and the increasing lack of machines
running 32-bit OSes, this is inevitably a low priority. The package is also
tested on Windows-on-ARM architecture, running in x64 emulation mode.

## Features and bugs

The current package only projects a subset of the Win32 API, but new APIs will
be added based on user demand. I'm particularly interested in unblocking plugins
for Windows. Please file feature requests and bugs at the [issue
tracker][tracker].

## Backwards compatibility

The library version uses semver, but you should not assume a strict guarantee of
no breaking changes between minor versions. That guarantee is not possible to
make, for several reasons:

- Several times, my fixing a bug in the fidelity of the Win32 API has tightened
  the constraints over a parameter (for example, `Pointer` becomes
  `Pointer<INPUT>`). These changes should be signalled in the log.
- Adding new features may itself cause a breaking change. For example, if you
  declare a missing Windows constant in your own code that is then added, Dart
  will complain about the duplicate definition.

One solution is to pin to a specific version of Win32, or declare a more
tightly-bounded version dependency (e.g. `'>=1.7.0 <1.8.0'` rather than merely
`^1.7.0`). But the best approach is simply to test regularly with the latest
version of this package, and continue to move your minimum forward. As the
package matures, these issues should gradually fade away.
