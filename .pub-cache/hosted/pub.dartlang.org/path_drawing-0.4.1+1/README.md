# path_drawing

A Flutter library to assist with creating and manipulating paths.

Currently supports parsing a `Path` from an SVG path data string
(including normalizing the path commands to be amenable to Flutter's exposed
Path methods).

Dash paths has an initial implementation that relies on flutter 0.3.6 at a minimum.

Planned for future release(s):

- Trim paths
