# moor Generator

This library contains the generator that turns your `Table` classes from moor
into database code. When using the moor, you'll probably want to use the 
moor_flutter implementation directly.

Please see the homepage of [moor](https://moor.simonbinder.eu/) or
the [moor_flutter package](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/moor_flutter) for details
on how to use this package.
