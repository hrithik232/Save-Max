# path_provider_windows

The Windows implementation of [`path_provider`][1].

## Usage

### Import the package

This package has been endorsed, meaning that you only need to add `path_provider`
as a dependency in your `pubspec.yaml`. It will be automatically included in your app
when you depend on `package:path_provider`.

This is what the above means to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
...
dependencies:
  ...
  path_provider: ^1.6.15
  ...
```
